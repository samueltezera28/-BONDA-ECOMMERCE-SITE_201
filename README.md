Our project helps people to buy and sell clothes quickly. Our team members are Eyuel Tekle, Samuel Tezera, and Eyasu Yidnekachew. As software engineers, we focus on developing light, responsive, and friendly web-app. Samuel worked on developing the API and Database system, Eyuel worked on project management and the landing page, and Eyasu worked on developing the Front-end (React), integrating and testing the API on the Front-end.

We are one of those guys who take half a day to shop for clothes. It is tough for me to get my desired clothes. So do my partners. In developing countries, especially in Ethiopia, second-hand clothes beat the market. Due to this, we decided to change this market to online. Our project can reduce the time taken to shop and choose clothes, and transport to.

We have used three servers for this project. M0 MongoDB atlas cloud server for the database and the other two run on localhost in different ports. One is the API and the other is the React Front-end server. The API is used for creating, updating, managing, and authenticating users: creating, categorizing, deleting, and updating the products. In general, the API connects with the database server and does all the data managing stuff. For Front-end development, we have used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and ReactJS. For backend development, we have used express and MongoDB. Our project has the following features:
Responsive design
Pagination for product display.
Admin Control
Categorize products
User dashboard for updating user information (will be implemented)
